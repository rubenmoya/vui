# VUI
> Run the Vue CLI GUI as a native application

VUI wraps the [Vue CLI GUI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#using-the-gui) with Electron to use it as a native application.

## Getting started
First you'll need to have installed [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/):

```sh
npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

Then, install VUI, you can find the latest versions in the [releases page](https://github.com/rubenmoya/vui/releases). After opening the application you can use it as you'd normally do use the [Vue CLI GUI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#using-the-gui) since this is just a wrapper.
